### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd VideoCallApp
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```
   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install
   
   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   # Run the server
   cd ../server
   npm run dev
   
   # In another terminal, run the client
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

4. For Windows users, you can use the restart.bat script:
   ```
   .\restart.bat
   ```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Deployment to Render

This application is configured for easy deployment to [Render](https://render.com/). We're using a combined deployment approach where the server serves both the backend API and the frontend static files.

### Using the Render Blueprint (Recommended)

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account

2. Sign up for a Render account at https://render.com/

3. From the Render dashboard, click "New" and select "Blueprint"

4. Connect your GitHub account and select your fork of this repository

5. Click "Apply Blueprint"

Render will automatically deploy the combined application based on the configuration in `render.yaml`.

### Manual Deployment (Combined Approach)

1. From the Render dashboard, click "New" â†’ "Web Service"

2. Connect your GitHub repository

3. Use the following settings:
   - **Name**: videocallapp
   - **Environment**: Node
   - **Build Command**: 
     ```
     cd server && npm install && cd ../client && npm install && npm run build && mkdir -p ../server/client && cp -r build/* ../server/client/
     ```
   - **Start Command**: `cd server && npm start`
   - **Plan**: Free (or select as needed)

4. Add the following environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
   - `REACT_APP_STUN_SERVERS`: `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302,stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302,stun:stun2.l.google.com:19302`

5. Click "Create Web Service"

### Troubleshooting Deployment

If you encounter issues with your deployment:

1. Check the `/debug` endpoint on your deployed server (e.g., https://your-app-name.onrender.com/debug) to see:
   - Environment information
   - File path availability 
   - Server status

2. Common issues:
   - Make sure the build command successfully copies the client build files to the correct location
   - Verify the Node.js version is compatible (Render uses Node.js 18 by default)
   - Check if the static files are being served correctly

### Post-Deployment

After deployment, your application will be available at the URL provided by Render.

Note that on the free tier of Render:
- The service will spin down after periods of inactivity
- The first request after inactivity may take a moment as the service spins up
